# HIPY - Haskell Interpreter for Python

HIPY is a Python interpreter written in Haskell. It aims to provide a lightweight and functional approach to executing Python code, leveraging Haskell's strong type system and purity to ensure correctness and maintainability.

## Features

### Planned features:

- ✅ Parsing of Python source code
- ✅ Evaluation of Python expressions and statements
- ✅ Support for basic Python data types (integers, strings, booleans etc.)
- ✅ Support for complex Python data types (lists, dictionaries etc.)
- ✅ Control flow structures (if/else, while, loops)
- ✅ Helpful errors
- ✅ Function definitions and calls
- ✅ Python standard library

### Not planning to implement:

- Object Oriented Programming (class, this, etc.)
- Concurrency (async, await etc.)

### Notes about implementation:

HIPY will return short descriptions for the errors it runs into but these do not catch everything due to not implementing certain features. You should therefore only use HIPY to run correct Python code where possible.

The Python standard library has been implemented with a focus on supporting functions that return primitive data types. This means that functions which either 1) return complex objects (e.g., numpy.matrix() creates a numpy.matrix object) or 2) modify variables in place without returning them (e.g., random.shuffle(x) updates x or os.abort()) are currently unsupported. While this limitation restricts the usage of certain libraries—most notably Pandas and NumPy—I’ve consciously chosen not to implement a linker and loader due to the complexity and scope involved. However, the implementation still supports a wide range of highly useful modules, such as random, math, os, time, and crypto, which are now available for use, providing significant functionality for many applications.

## Installation

To build HIPY, you will need:

- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) >= 9.0.0  
- Cabal for dependency management  

### Using cabal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/coloursplash/hipy.git
cd hipy
cabal build
cabal run . -- example.py
```

## Usage
HIPY runs Python scripts passed as command-line arguments:

```sh
hipy script.py
```

### Example
Create a Python script:

```python
# script.py
x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)  # Output: 30
```

Run it with:

```python
hipy script.py
```
